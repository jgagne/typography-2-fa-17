## Bespoke Character

![Ampersand Pixel Preview](./img/01-ampersand-pixel-preview.png)

> “The ampersand is the one glyph where type designers are able to let loose and be a little more creative.”

The ampersand (&): once considered the 27th letter of the alphabet; born of a Latin phrase; now a long-standing character; rich in personality and history that’s become a favorite among designers and type designers alike.


### Brief

Design a bespoke ampersand (&) for print and web, as an alternate glyph for a serif, sans-serif, or monospace web safe font.


### Work & Rubric

Copy and paste section into a new `issue` within your repo and title it as *Work & Rubric*. [`#tasklist`](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents)

#### Standard

`20 points`

- [ ] Sketches begin on paper: graph, grid, dot, etc. (capture and document your process)
- [ ] Maintain a repo for this project on GitHub with sketches et al. assets (`.indd`, `.idml`, `.html`, etc.)
- [ ] Use of InDesign, Illustrator, or Sketch for ampersand design, and InDesign and Text Editor (HTML & CSS) for layout `#nophotoshop` `#nodreamweaverormuse`
- [ ] Use of black only, designer black or rich black, no grayscale

#### Different Designs for Different Sizes

`20 points`

Design an alternate `normal` or `bold` weight ampersand, working from a scale of a low-res favicon (1em x 1em or 16pt/px x 16 pt/px) through a hi-res banner type size (16em x 16em or 256pt/px x 256pt/px).

- [ ] One favicon @ 1em x 1em, `.png` and `.ico` format
- [ ] One display type size @ 2em x 2em, `svg` format
- [ ] One display type size @ 3em x 3em, `svg` format
- [ ] One banner type size @ 16em x 16em, `svg` format

#### Character

`20 points`

- [ ] Original (design)
- [ ] Unpredictable (experience)
- [ ] Whimsical (emotion)
- [ ] Elegant (bézier curves)

#### Printed Matter (Print Matters)

`20 points`

Design a poster, comparing and contrasting the web safe font’s original ampersand to yours in a range of real-world use cases.

- [ ] Use of character and paragraphs styles
- [ ] Exclusive use of selected web safe font for all other text: headings, body text, captions, etc.
- [ ] Print one or more posters, 18in x 24in or larger (19in x 25in for bleeds), black only (100% or 4-color black)
- [ ] Print on white or color 80# `text` or 65# `cover` or lighter weight paper stock
  - A color stock should be well considered `#colortalks`
  - If you do decide to make use of color paper stock, stay away from the use of knockout due to difficulties in reproducing even coverage of large amounts of black (toner) as a background
  - Output at a print shop with a large format A&E (Architectural & Engineering) black and white graphics plotter/photocopier
    - CCI Reprographics, `978 922 3773`, @ 110 Cabot Street, is a local print shop that can provide output and various paper stocks. Stop by or call ahead for pricing and paper stock availability. Call ahead and ask for John; tell him you’re a student studying design, and bring your files (`.idml` with all dependencies, or `.pdf`) with an 11in x 17in black and white proof, and any paper samples (with extras), so that he may better assist you. `#beprepared` `#beprofessional`
    - [French Paper Co.](http://www.frenchpaper.com) offers a lot of choices for 19in x 25in cut sheet paper in a range of colors and weights, and can be ordered in small counts of 25 (extra sheets come in handy) for under $35–50. Considering ordering paper in groups to save on costs `#frenchpaper`
    - **Note:** Paper stock in heavier weights will not run through a large format photocopier with good results; a paper jam or uneven toner coverage and fusing will result `#avoid`

#### Screen Time

`20 points`

Design a single-page, responsive webpage based on a simplified version of your printed poster.

- [ ] Use of CSS Grid Layout and media queries for small-to-wide responsive layout
- [ ] Use of optimized SVG files for ampersands with flexible images HTML and CSS
- [ ] Exclusive use of selected web safe font for all other text: headings, body text, captions, etc.
- [ ] Link ampersand favicon `.ico` and 512px x 512px `.png` for a Twitter/OG image

- - -

#### Style (Extra Credit)

*True italic*, not fake, slanted.

`20 points`

Design an alternate `italic` style (slanted) ampersand, working from a scale of a low-res favicon (1em x 1em or 16pt/px x 16 pt/px) through a hi-res banner type size (16em x 16em or 256pt/px x 256pt/px).

- [ ] One favicon @ 1em x 1em, `.png` and `.ico` format
- [ ] One display type size @ 2em x 2em, `svg` format
- [ ] One display type size @ 3em x 3em, `svg` format
- [ ] One banner type size @ 16em x 16em, `svg` format


### Warm-Up

`60 minutes`

#### And Per Sketch

![Ampersand Grid Sketch Template](./img/01-ampersand-sketch-grid.png)

> “Usually, letters help to form one another, by setting precedents and providing contexts. But the ampersand doesn’t receive any of that support. That makes it hard to draw, because so many different shapes might look plausible at first. But it also opens an unusually large window for experimentation and risk. It’s how the designer can put on a fireworks show in this one shape, especially in seriffed italics.”
>
> —[Tobias Frere-Jones](https://frerejones.com/about), one of the world’s leading typeface designers

#### Details

##### Instructor

1. As a class watch [*My Life in Typefaces* with Matthew Carter](https://www.ted.com/talks/matthew_carter_my_life_in_typefaces) `video`
2. As a class, discuss the importance and process of drawing type and watch [On Sketching](https://vimeo.com/11491627) `video`
3. Demo how to create an InDesign grid template for sketching using the gridify technique with custom character, paragraph, and object styles (see `/warm-ups/01-ampersand-sketch-grid/` for reference)

##### Student(s)

1. Select a serif, sans-serif, or monospace web safe font
2. Setup and save ampersand sketch grid
3. Print out two or three copies (one for now and a couple for later)
4. Sketch at least 8 ampersands in 30 minutes
5. Repeat for homework, sans time limit

> "If you haven’t surprised yourself yet, you haven’t done enough sketching."
