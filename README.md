## Elements of Typographic Structure and Style for Print and Web

> “Typography is two-dimensional architecture, based on experience and imagination, and guided by rules and readability. And this is the purpose of typography: The arrangement of design elements within a given structure should allow the reader to easily focus on the message, without slowing down the speed of his reading.” —[Hermann Zapf](https://www.linotype.com/1494/the-lifestory-of-hermann-zapf.html), type designer, writer, calligrapher, and designer (1918–2015)
