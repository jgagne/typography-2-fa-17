			<p class="body-text">Remember it’s called the creative process; it’s not the creative bleeping moment. If you’re not being bleeping honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Make your work consistent but not bleeping predictable. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity the creative act involves this element of newness and experimentalism, then one must expect and accept the bleeping possibility of failure. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great bleeping work. You must overcome yourself. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard bleeping work. Intuition is bleeping important. Design is all about bleeping relationships, the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Nothing of value comes to you without bleeping working at it.</p>
