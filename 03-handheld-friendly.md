# Handheld Friendly

> Losing 80% of your screen space forces you to focus. You need to make sure that what stays on the screen is the most important set of features for your customers and your business. There simply isn’t room for any interface debris or content of questionable value. You need to know what matters most.

## Brief

Design a pair of small notebooks, pocket to reporter size, filled with plain, ruled, graph, grid, dot, or any other format of paper wrapped in a rugged functional cover, and a promotional companion website — all based on a typographical theme or use case.

The 2-pack of notebooks may be identical or different, but based on the same theme, and packaged, wrapped with a branded band.
